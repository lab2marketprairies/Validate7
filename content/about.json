Participants who complete the Lab2Market program are rewarded with critical entrepreneurial skills and $10,000 (through Mitacs and PrairiesCan) to help fund their research. This program encourages researchers to challenge their lab findings and test whether there is a need for their innovation in the commercial market.",
